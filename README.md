# Bellybutton-Biodiversity

#### Overview
Researchers are looking for methods of food production that are both considered to be more ethical than meat from farm animals and sufficient in nutrient profile, primarily in protein. To do so, they have been testing various bacteria that produce such protein as a by-product of their normal life functions. As it turns out, some proportion of people have such bacteria in their belly buttons. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the people and behaviors that may lead to an increase in these bacterial samples. 

#### Project
My role in this study was to create a dashboard that would allow the researchers to examine the data collected for each subject of the study. To do so, three figures are presented in a website that is hosted through Github Pages. It allows a researcher to select the subject's ID number, then updates the figures for that individual's data. It also displays the demographic information for the selected individual.

The first graph is a bar chart that shows the top ten bacteria from the belly button sample. It also displays the number of each bacteria in the sample. A bubble chart displays similar information in a format that may be easier for a researcher to use. Finally, a gauge graphic indicates the reported weekly belly button washings of the selected subject. 

In this case, the research team did not yet ask me to provide any analysis of the data, as they will likely use the dashboard to conduct their own analysis.
